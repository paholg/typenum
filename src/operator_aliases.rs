//! This module provides aliases for the type operators used in this crate. Their purpose is
//! to increase the ergonomics of performing operations on the types defined here.
//!
//! For example, type `X` and type `Y` are the same here:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::ops::Mul;
//! use typenum::{Prod, P5, P7};
//!
//! type X = <P7 as Mul<P5>>::Output;
//! type Y = Prod<P7, P5>;
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Aliases!!!
